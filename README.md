[fullPage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js) Angular Directive
====

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/hellsan631/angular-fullpage.js/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/hellsan631/angular-fullpage.js)

A simple [fullPage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js) directive that allows
the use of fullPage.js within an angular app. There are several issues when using the the vanilla jquery
version with an angular application that uses an internal router for displaying pages, and this repo
aims to solve them.

[Example](http://hellsan631.github.io/angular-fullpage.js/)

Most of this is a placeholder, with more to come.
